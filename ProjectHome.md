Vanilla is not like any WordPress theme you’ve used before!

And what you see now is just the beginning. I’d write up a roadmap but it would scare me too much ;)

Vanilla’s key boast is this:

**Exceptional power and freedom for designers, without (or barely) needing to know or touch PHP. Thanks to the combined capabilities of PHPTAL templates, Carrington’s atomic templates, YUI CSS and full widgetization (including custom widget controls).**

Here’s the really short summary of its features:

  1. PHPTAL templating engine (including caching).
  1. “Template Sets” for different styles: blog, photoblog, corporate and magazine.
  1. Carrington's "atomic" templating system.
  1. Custom layouts and bullet-proof CSS.
  1. Sandbox's semantic markup (body/post/comment classes, etc).
  1. Widget blocks for all key page areas, not just sidebars.
  1. Custom widget controls.
  1. Theme-specific hooks and filters throughout.
  1. Built for "child themes".
  1. Extensive and granular theme controls (in the Admin area).
  1. HTML “minifier” compresses output for speed.

And once it goes public...

  1. Free to download and use; released under the GPL.
  1. Paid support option, including helpdesk, discussion groups, bug fixes, etc.
  1. Extensive documentation (plus tutorial videos for paid/supported option).

A few of these features are not fully implemented yet or need sample code written to show them off. So you’ll need to be patient or get on board and help get the work done!
